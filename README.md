**Data Analyst With SQL** career classes from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). 

I have taken courses related to `SQL` and `Database` on campus, the reason why I took the career track classes is to **Connect the Dots...**. 

This set of courses helps me to stick all the fragments about SQL and establish a complete overview.
