# SQL window function

## 1. Basic window syntax
```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY start_time)
         AS running_total
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
```

## 2. with SUM COUNT,and AVG
```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS running_total,
       COUNT(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS running_count,
       AVG(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal) AS running_avg
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
```

## 3. Running Value with order by
```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY start_time)
         AS running_total,
       COUNT(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY start_time)
         AS running_count,
       AVG(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY start_time)
         AS running_avg
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
```

## 4. ROW_NUMBER()

```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       start_time,
       duration_seconds,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY start_terminal
                          ORDER BY start_time)
                    AS row_number
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
```

## 5. RANK() and DENSE_RANK()

+ `RANK()` would give the identical rows a rank of 2, then skip ranks 3 and 4, so the next result would be 5
+ `DENSE_RANK()` would still give all the identical rows a rank of 2, but the following row would be 3â€”no ranks would be skipped.

```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY start_terminal
                    ORDER BY start_time)
              AS rank
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
 ```
## 6. LAG and LEAD
`LAG` pulls from previous rows and `LEAD` pulls from following rows.

```sql
SELECT start_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       LAG(duration_seconds, 1) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY duration_seconds) AS lag,
       LEAD(duration_seconds, 1) OVER
         (PARTITION BY start_terminal ORDER BY duration_seconds) AS lead
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
 ORDER BY start_terminal, duration_seconds
```

## 7. ROWS Clause: Syntax and Options
+ `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` -- All rows before the current row.
+ `n PRECEDING` -- n rows before the current row.
+ `CURRENT ROW` -- Just the current row.
+ `n FOLLOWING` -- n rows after the current row.
+ `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` -- All rows after the current row.

```sql
SELECT date, revenue,
    SUM(revenue) OVER (
      ORDER BY date
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) running_total
FROM sales
ORDER BY date;
```
## 8. LAST_VALUE, FIRST_VALUE
